## Hi there 👋

I'm coming back to GitHub (since most of the cross-repos I use are here anyways and MS didn't change many things yet, so all is good). I like to use GitHub to start new projects, test them for a while, and then move on to something else.

Don't worry boss, I'm not like that at work (I think). What I do for a living vs what I do in GitHub may not always intersect. And that's ok.

### ❤️ Love to learn more about

* Modular and reusable things.
* Elegant, easy to understand, simple and well maintained architecture and design.

### 💪 Want to get better at

* Maintaining my repos, but at the same time, getting better at giving up on something I’ve invested time in and need to let go of.
* Creating something really really big (feature wise, thought getting a lot of stars would be very nice too)

### 🤓 My GitHub portfolio

Again, not necessarily what I work on in my daily life but it will be mostly about:

* Full stack JavaScript (except likely the DB)
* CI/CD
* CLI/Automation tools
* APIs (Rest, GraphQL, etc.)
